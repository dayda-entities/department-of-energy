Depicts the area of activities to implement the Western Bark Beetle Strategy. Activities were self-reported by field units, and center around three main objectives: increasing safety to ensure that people and community infrastructure are protected from the hazards of falling bark beetle-killed trees and elevated wildfire potential, facilitating recovery to re-establish forests damaged by bark beetles, and cultivating resiliency to prevent or mitigate future bark beetle impacts. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_WBBS_LN.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
